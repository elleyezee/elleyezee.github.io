	<!-- code where we create and name the container that holds the map -->
	<div id="map" style="height: 80%"></div>
	<p>This map depicts all earthquakes that have occurred in the past 24 hours. Data comes from the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php">USGS Live Earthquake Feed</a> and is updated every minute. Earthquakes are visualized with proportional symbols where earthquakes of larger magnitude are depicted with larger circle markers. Click on a marker for more information about the earthquake.</p>
		<p>The Pacific Northwest lies along the Cascadia fault. Tectonic activity along this fault could cause a catastrophic earthquake that would produce major damage throughout our region. Learn about how researchers at the University of Washington are modelling earthquake risk and preparing for disaster response at the <a href="https://hazards.uw.edu/geology/m9/">M9 Project</a>.</p>
